## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Don't worry if you don't have everything - we'll guide you through installation in the tutorial videos!

**Required:**
- Python 3.10+ (we recommend 3.12)
- Node.js 18+
- OpenAI API key (we'll show you how to get one)

**Nice to have:**
- Docker Desktop (makes setup easier, but optional)
- Git basics

### üì¶ Quick Setup

**Option 1: Docker (Recommended for Beginners)**
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aparsoft/django-nextjs-chatbot.git
cd django-nextjs-chatbot

# Create .env file (we'll guide you)
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env

# Start everything with one command!
docker-compose up
```

That's it! Open `http://localhost:3000` and start chatting.

**Option 2: Manual Setup (If you want to understand each piece)**

We recommend following our YouTube tutorial "[Setting Up Your Django + Next.js Chatbot](https://youtube.com/@aparsoft)" where we walk through each command. Here are the complete steps:

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aparsoft/django-nextjs-chatbot.git
cd django-nextjs-chatbot
```

**Step 2: Backend Setup (Django)**
```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file for backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# Run database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (optional, for admin access)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start the Django development server
python manage.py runserver
# Backend will run on http://localhost:8000
```

**Step 3: Frontend Setup (Next.js with .jsx)**
```bash
# Open a new terminal window
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
# or if you prefer yarn:
# yarn install

# Create .env.local file for frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and set:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev
# or with yarn:
# yarn dev
# Frontend will run on http://localhost:3000
```

**Step 4: Test Your Setup**
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- You should see the chatbot interface
- Try sending a message - it should connect to your Django backend
- Backend API docs available at `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- **Port already in use?** Change ports in settings
- **Module not found?** Make sure virtual environment is activated
- **Database errors?** Run migrations again
- **API not connecting?** Check CORS settings in Django

### üîë Getting Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new key
5. Add $5-10 credit (plenty for learning!)
